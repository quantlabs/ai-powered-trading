How to Build and Deploy the Trading Engine Script
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up, running, and deploying the console-based trading engine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Basic command line knowledge
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First, create a directory for your project and set up a virtual environment:

bash


# Create project directory
mkdir trading_engine
cd trading_engine

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:



numpy==1.23.5
pandas==1.5.3
scipy==1.10.1
Then install the dependencies:

bash


pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Create the Script
Create a new file named trading_engine.py and paste the entire console application code into it.

Step 4: Run the Script
Run the script from the command line:

bash


python trading_engine.py
The console interface will appear, and you can navigate through the menu options.

Step 5: Deploy as a Standalone Application
Option 1: Create an Executable
You can use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable:

bash


# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Create executable
pyinstaller --onefile trading_engine.py
The executable will be created in the dist directory and can be run on any compatible system without Python installed.

Option 2: Schedule Regular Runs
On Windows (using Task Scheduler):
Open Task Scheduler
Click "Create Basic Task"
Name your task (e.g., "Trading Engine")
Choose when to run the task (daily, weekly, etc.)
Select "Start a program"
Browse to your Python executable (in the virtual environment) and add the script path as an argument:
Program: C:\path\to\venv\Scripts\python.exe
Arguments: C:\path\to\trading_engine.py
Complete the wizard
On macOS/Linux (using Cron):
Open your crontab file:

bash


crontab -e
Add a line to run the script (e.g., every day at 9 AM):

basic


0 9 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/trading_engine.py
Option 3: Run as a System Service
On Linux (using Systemd):
Create a service file at /etc/systemd/system/trading-engine.service:
ini


[Unit]
Description=Trading Engine Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/project
ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/trading_engine.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable and start the service:
bash


sudo systemctl enable trading-engine
sudo systemctl start trading-engine
Step 6: Running in the Cloud (Optional)
To run on a cloud server:

Set up a virtual machine (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, etc.)
SSH into the machine
Follow the steps above to set up the environment and script
Use screen or tmux to keep the script running when you disconnect:
bash


# Install screen
sudo apt-get install screen

# Start a new screen session
screen -S trading

# Run your script
python trading_engine.py

# Detach from screen (but leave it running) by pressing:
# Ctrl+A followed by D

# Later, to reattach:
screen -r trading
Tips for Deployment
Logging: Add file logging to record trading activity:
python

Run


import logging

# At the top of your script
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='trading_engine.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Then use logging throughout your code
logging.info("Trade executed: Silver bear put spread")
Configuration File: Extract key parameters to a config file:
Create config.json:

json


{
  "refresh_rate": 10,
  "initial_portfolio_value": 2500,
  "max_positions_per_instrument": 3
}
Then in your code:

python

Run


import json

with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Use config values
state.refresh_rate = config['refresh_rate']
Headless Mode: Add a command-line argument for running without user interaction:
python

Run


import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Trading Engine')
parser.add_argument('--headless', action='store_true', help='Run in headless mode')
args = parser.parse_args()

if args.headless:
    # Run without UI, just process trades and log results
    while True:
        refresh_data()
        time.sleep(state.refresh_rate)
else:
    # Run with interactive UI
    main()
This allows you to run the script in headless mode when deploying as a service:

bash


python trading_engine.py --headless
By following these steps, you'll be able to build, run, and deploy your trading engine on various systems.
